# Tree and Graph

- what is tree in data structure?
  **tree** has one node on top and one or many branches and sub-branches beneath it.

> > **binary tree** is a typical tree that always has 2 branches under its node (left and right), while left node's value always smaller than parent node's value, right node are on the opposite way.

- what is graph in data structure?

> > **graph** is nodes network connect with each others with/without any rules apply to it. (**tree** is sub-set of **graph**)
